            <h2>What is EthnoMedix?</h2>
            <p>EthnoMedix is a knowledge-based system (KBS) designed to document and preserve the rich ethnomedicinal knowledge of the Higaonon tribe in Iligan City, particularly in Rogongon. This system serves as a digital repository that ensures valuable healing wisdom is not lost to time.</p>

            <h2>Why EthnoMedix?</h2>
            <p>For generations, the Higaonon people have relied on natureâ€™s bounty for healing, using medicinal plants to treat various ailments. However, this knowledge is at risk of fading due to modernization and limited documentation. EthnoMedix bridges this gap by systematically organizing and storing this information.</p>
